/**
 * @brief WindowAggregationHandle encapsulates logic for actually computing
 *        window aggregates with particular argument(s).
 * @note See also WindowAggregateFunction, which represents a SQL aggregate
 *       function in the abstract sense.
 *
 * A WindowAggregationHandle is created by calling
 * WindowAggregateFunction::createHandle(). The WindowAggregationHandle object
 * provides methods that are used to actually compute the window aggregate,
 * storing intermediate results in WindowAggregationState objects.
 *
 * The work flow for computing a window aggregate is:
 *     1. Create an initial state by createInitialState().
 *     2. One thread will handle all the computation, iterating from the first
 *        tuple to the last tuple. Note there will be two modes that could be
 *        used upon different situations:
 *        a. If the window aggregate is defined as accumulative, which are:
 *           i.  Functions applied to whole partition, such as rank(), ntile()
 *               and dense_rank().
 *           ii. The window frame is defined as "BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
 *               AND CURRENT ROW" or "BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED
 *               FOLLOWING".
 *           Then, for functions except median, we could store some global
 *           values in the state without keeping all the tuple values around.
 *        b. If the window frame is sliding, such as "BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND
 *           3 FOLLOWING", we have to store all the tuples in the state so that
 *           we could know which values should be dropped as the window slides.
 *        For each computed value, generate a tuple store in the column vector.
 *     3. Insert the new column into the original relation and return.
 *
 * TODO(Shixuan): Currently we don't support parallelization. The basic idea for
 * parallelization is to calculate the partial result inside each block. Each
 * block could visit the following blocks as long as the block's last partition
 * is not finished. WindowAggregationOperationState will be used for handling
 * the global state of the calculation.
